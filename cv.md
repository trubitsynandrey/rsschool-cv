Unfortunately, I don't have any experience in an **IT** company, but lately *(almost a year and a half)* I found that pair javascript-Html-CSS very interesting. And I think it's a good start point - ***Front-end development*** to move forward my skills and start a career in this sphere.

At this time I'm working as a **mechanical engineer**. Drawings on some machinery parts are what I do. It's not bringing me any satisfaction and excitement anymore.
I started to improve my English language in 2019 and found that I can't apply any of my new skills to my job. But it's still very cool to be able to read *Harry Potter* in original though 😄 .

I'm learning at sources like Youtube and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). I've already passed: 
- [x] the basics of JS, Html, and CSS. 
- [x] Learned how to interact with **DOM** structure by JS. 
- [x] Even learned how to make a slider :blush: and much more.
- [ ] But I still need to concrete and sort my knowledge about all of this.

I'm looking forward to starting full-time job in the IT-sphere, for me, it's a new ***challenge*** in life and an opportunity to expand and apply my skills and potential. And it will motivate me more, than just trying to learn on my own, yet I'm aware of the self-independence of working as a programmer. And still, in my opinion, learn all of this being in the company it's a big difference.

p.s: I hope there's not too much grammar and other mistakes in my Eng. I can consume it on a decent level, but not produce :innocent: .
