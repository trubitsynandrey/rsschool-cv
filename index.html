    <h3>Foreword</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, I don’t have any experience in an IT company, but lately (almost a year and a half) I found that
      pair javascript-Html-CSS very interesting. And I think it’s a good start point - Front-end development to move
      forward my skills and start a career in this sphere.</p>

    <h3>This days experience</h3>
    <p> At this time I’m working as a mechanical engineer. Drawings on some machinery parts are what I do. It’s not
      bringing me any satisfaction and excitement anymore. I started to improve my English language in 2019 and found
      that I can’t apply any of my new skills to my job. But it’s still very cool to be able to read Harry Potter in
      original though.</p>

    <h3>Front-end knowledge</h3>
    <p>I’m learning at sources like Youtube and Udemy. I’ve already passed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the basics of JS, Html, and CSS.</li>
      <li>Learned how to interact with DOM structure by JS.</li>
      <li>Even learned how to make a slider and much more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But I still need to concrete and sort my knowledge about all of this.
      I’m looking forward to starting full-time job in the IT-sphere, for me, it’s a new challenge in life and an
      opportunity to expand and apply my skills and potential. And it will motivate me more, than just trying to learn
      on my own, yet I’m aware of the self-independence of working as a programmer. And still, in my opinion, learn all
      of this being in the company it’s a big difference.</p>

    <p> P.S: I hope there’s not too much grammar and other mistakes in my Eng. I can consume it on a decent level, but
      not
      produce. .
